Introduction


Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations worldwide. Traditional phishing detection methods often fall short in identifying sophisticated attacks. This project addresses this challenge by combining Big Data processing capabilities with state-of-the-art NLP techniques to analyze and classify emails on a massive scale.


Features
Scalable Data Processing: Utilizes Apache Spark for distributed data processing of large email datasets.
Advanced NLP Models: Implements Large Language Models (LLM) like BERT and GPT for deep semantic analysis.
Real-time Detection: Supports real-time email analysis using Apache Kafka for streaming data.
API Integration: Provides RESTful APIs for easy integration with email servers and clients.
Continuous Learning: Incorporates mechanisms for model retraining based on new data to adapt to evolving phishing techniques.
Monitoring and Logging: Includes monitoring tools for performance tracking and logging for auditing purposes.
Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:

1. Data Ingestion: Collects emails from various sources and streams them using Apache Kafka.
2. Data Storage: Stores emails in a distributed file system (HDFS) and NoSQL databases like HBase or Cassandra.
3. Data Processing: Processes and cleans data using Apache Spark, preparing it for model training and inference.
4. Model Training: Trains LLMs using TensorFlowOnSpark or PyTorch with Spark for distributed training.
5. Model Serving: Deploys models using TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe, accessible via RESTful APIs.
6. Integration Layer: Connects the model serving APIs with email systems for real-time detection.
7. Monitoring and Updates: Monitors system performance and updates models as needed.
